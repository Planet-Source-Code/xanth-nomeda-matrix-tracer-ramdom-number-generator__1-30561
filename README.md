### Description

This is a re-done version of Nick Romanelli's Matrix Tracer code(http://pscode.com/xq/ASP/txtCodeId.21214/lngWId.1/qx/vb/scripts/ShowCode.htm).

I have left his origonal forms in there with the code untouched so you can see the big difference.

I have added a small command-line parsing function which controls the program.

Im sure there are better ways of doing this than I have, so please, any comments or suggestions are welcome. Again, the new code is all mine, but the concept was Nick Romanelli's.
